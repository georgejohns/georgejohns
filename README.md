## hello and such! i'm george
 i'm an epidemiology student who was very afraid of computers just about two years ago...
 failed to realize they were super important for my degree, so here we are!
 SAS, GIS, and *now* R enthusiast studying the intersection of:
**CLIMATE! CONFLICT! INDUSTRY! AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE!**
spending most of my time on here poking around at the datasets of folks far more impressive than i :-)
